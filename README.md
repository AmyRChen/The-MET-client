## The Metropolitan Museum web app
Production: https://web-422-a6-client.vercel.app/
This is a full-stack application with authentication, authorization, browsing history, and favorites features. Users can sign up to view The Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection online. Account holders can review their browsing history and favorite collections.

I built this application because during the pandemic, people have had limited opportunities to visit museums. By visiting this application, people can explore the MET online!
